H400,我們現在默思，葡萄一生的事：,"Consider now, dear ones, the life of a grapevine.",1,1,Verse
H400,其路並不容易，其境也不安逸；,"It has no easy life, its hardships intertwine;",2,1,Verse
H400,不像，不像野地野花，隨地隨意吐華，,"Unlike wild flowers in the field that gayly, wildly bloom,",3,1,Verse
H400,生成，生成曲徑迷堂，生成款式百樣。,"In countless patterns up they grow, full liberty assume.",4,1,Verse
H400,反之葡萄開花，非常渺小無華，,The flowers of the vine are plain and small in size;,1,2,Verse
H400,人幾不能辨省，牠竟也曾有英；,"So humbly do they bloom, unnoticed by most eyes.",2,2,Verse
H400,花未，花未開得一日，即已結為果實，,"The time for blossoms is so short, soon into fruit they grow.",3,2,Verse
H400,不得，不得成為驕葩，自感丰姿可誇。,"No charm is there for them to boast, no elegance to show.",4,2,Verse
H400,牠是拴在樁上，不能隨意生長，,"So fastened to a post, it cannot freely grow;",1,3,Verse
H400,牠如伸肢展臂，也是架上被繫；,Up to the trellises its branches tied must go.,2,3,Verse
H400,牠就，牠就從了礫土，吸取牠的食物，,From stony soil the vine is forced to draw its food supply;,3,3,Verse
H400,道路，道路不能揀選，不能想要變遷。,"It has no way to change its course, or from its hardship fly.",4,3,Verse
H400,是的，綠衣秀美，春地披上明媚，,How lovely is the green of Spring's beautiful scene!,1,4,Verse
H400,因著生命豐裕，自然生長有餘；,"So natural is its growth, with brightness so serene.",2,4,Verse
H400,滿身，滿身嫩枝細苗，開始飄浮盤繞，,"Out of the vine's abundant life so full and so complete,",3,4,Verse
H400,在於，在於青藍空中，得嘗甘美無窮。,"Against the azure, branches flow to taste the air so sweet.",4,4,Verse
H400,但是園主園工，對牠並不放鬆，,"Behold, the master comes His guidance to provide;",1,5,Verse
H400,帶著刈剪修刀，要剝牠的驕傲；,"The pruning knife he brings to strip it of its pride,",2,5,Verse
H400,毫不，毫不顧惜細嫩，將牠割到標準，,"Not minding all its tender shoots, to cleanse and cleanse again,",3,5,Verse
H400,所有，所有多餘美穗，都被斷折破碎。,Till all excessive branches fall to comply with his plan.,4,5,Verse
H400,在牠損失期間，牠並不敢自憐，,"During this time of loss, dare it self-pity show?",1,6,Verse
H400,乃是反將自己，更為完全徹底；,"No, no, it yields but more to him who wounds it so,",2,6,Verse
H400,交給，交給剝奪所有，使牠虛空的手，,"Yes, to the hand that strips it of all glory and all pride.",3,6,Verse
H400,牠力，牠力不肯損失，一切都為結實。,The vine thus keeps the strength of life that much fruit may abide.,4,6,Verse
H400,那些流血的枝，漸變堅硬木質，,"To hardened wood is turned each stump of bleeding shoot,",1,7,Verse
H400,那些存留的穗，也漸結果纍纍；,And each remaining branch brings forth abundant fruit.,2,7,Verse
H400,太陽，太陽迫牠枯乾，牠葉開始落散，,"Scorched by the burning sun, its leaves turn dry and fall away.",3,7,Verse
H400,使牠，使牠果子盛紫，直至收成日子。,The fruit thus ripens more and more until the harvest day.,4,7,Verse
H400,牠因負重過甚，致牠無枝不沉-,"Due to the fruitful load, the branches are brought low,",1,8,Verse
H400,這是長期努力，受盡琢磨來的-,The consequence of pain and many a thoughtful blow.,2,8,Verse
H400,現今，現今果已全美，自然牠可自慰；,"In bearing clusters of fine fruit, comforted it must be;",3,8,Verse
H400,但是，但是收成已到，欣慰日子已少。,"But soon will come the harvest time, the days of comfort flee.",4,8,Verse
H400,有手要來摘下，有腳要來踐踏，,Upon the hand-picked fruit comes treading of the feet.,1,9,Verse
H400,葡萄所有寶藏，在於酒醡之上，,The greatest treasure lies where grapes and wine-press meet.,2,9,Verse
H400,直到，直到豐富紅酒，有如長江大流，,"When grapes are crushed inside the press, red wine begins to flow,",3,9,Verse
H400,源源，源源滾湧不息，喜樂遍滿全地。,Like surging rivers bringing joy the earth to overflow.,4,9,Verse
H400,但是葡萄形狀，乃是剝光淒涼，,"So barren is the vine, its all is spent in full,",1,10,Verse
H400,已經給了一切，又將進入黑夜；,And now its plight again is dreary night and woe.,2,10,Verse
H400,無人，無人向牠償還，牠所給人醉歡，,No one would stoop to thank the vine for cheering wine that's drunk;,3,10,Verse
H400,反而，反而將牠再砍，成為無枝禿幹。,"Instead, more stripping is at hand to make a branchless trunk.",4,10,Verse
H400,然而全冬之間，牠酒卻賜甘甜，,"Throughout the winter time, its wine gives warmth, and cheers",1,11,Verse
H400,給那寒冷之中，憂鬱愁苦之眾；,The shiv'ring ones whose chill is mixed with grief and tears.,2,11,Verse
H400,但牠，但牠卻在外面，經歷雪地冰天，,"But midst the ice and snow without, the vine is thus to stand.",3,11,Verse
H400,前來，前來忍受一切，一切何其難解。,Why does it strive to bear it all? It's hard to understand.,4,11,Verse
H400,直到寒冬已過，牠又豫備結果，,"When winter's o'er, it yearns once more much fruit to bear.",1,12,Verse
H400,重新萌芽生枝，再來放綠成姿，,New shoots come forth again to weave its garment fair.,2,12,Verse
H400,不因，不因所受磨難，心中埋怨不甘，,It has no murm'ring or complaint for winter's sore abuse.,3,12,Verse
H400,不因，不因損失無限，而欲減少奉獻。,"Its all it gives, and still wills not its off'ring to reduce.",4,12,Verse
H400,牠的所有呼吸，盡是高天清氣，,"It stretches up toward heav'n, and breathes the fresh clean air.",1,13,Verse
H400,並不半點沾染不潔屬己情感；,"Untouched by earthly joy, self-love it does not bear.",2,13,Verse
H400,面向，面向犧牲含笑，再來接受雕削，,"It smiles at sacrifice ahead, accepting odds once more;",3,13,Verse
H400,有如，有如從未遇過損失或者折磨。,"As if no strokes, no stripping sore can it ever recall.",4,13,Verse
H400,葡萄從牠肢枝，流酒、流血、流汁，,Much sap and wine and blood out from its branches flow.,1,14,Verse
H400,是否因己捨盡，牠就變為更貧？,Does emptying itself cause it more poor to grow?,2,14,Verse
H400,世上，世上醉人浪者，從牠暢飲、作樂，,"From it, drunkards and wanderers do drink and merry make.",3,14,Verse
H400,他們，他們是否享福？能否變為更富？,"Do they, from pleasure much, become more wealthy when they wake?",4,14,Verse
H400,估量生命原則，以失不是以得；,"Measure your life by loss, never measure by gain;",1,15,Verse
H400,不視酒飲幾多，乃視酒傾幾何；,"Not by much wine consumed, but wine poured out in pain.",2,15,Verse
H400,因為，因為愛的能力，是在愛的捨棄；,The strength of love stands ever in love's sacrifice to show.,3,15,Verse
H400,誰苦，誰苦受得最深，最有可以給人。,"The more one suffers, then the more true love can he bestow.",4,15,Verse
H400,誰待自己最苛，最易為神選擇；,He who spares not himself is best for God to gain;,1,16,Verse
H400,誰傷自己最狠，最能擦人淚痕；,Who hurts himself the most can best soothe those in pain.,2,16,Verse
H400,誰不，誰不熟練剝奪，誰是鳴鈸響鑼；,"Unless well-learned in being stripped, a sounding brass is he.",3,16,Verse
H400,誰能，誰能拯救自己，誰就不能樂極。,"Unless averse to saving self, ne'er can he blissful be.",4,16,Verse

H489,救主掌握我寶藏，祂要和我同行。,"My Savior has my treasure, and He will walk with me.",4,3,Verse
H489,或許明朝天未曉，我靈不及等待，,"In heav'nly love abiding, no change my heart shall fear;",1,4,Verse
H489,就脫肉體全不要，主，就與祢同在。,"And safe is such confiding, for nothing changes here.",2,4,Verse
H489,安息！睡眠！何寶貴，有祢保護照顧；,The storm may roar without me; my heart may low be laid;,3,4,Verse
H489,或許祢忽榮耀歸，召我座前相晤！,But God is round about me; and can I be dismayed?,4,4,Verse
H489,那時看見祢自己，被眾選民擁擠；,"Wherever He may guide me, no want shall turn me back;",1,5,Verse
H489,又是榮耀，又美麗，又是歌唱無已。,"My Shepherd is beside me, and nothing can I lack:",2,5,Verse
